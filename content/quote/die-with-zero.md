> I’d rather spend my time and energy trying to live the most fulfilling life I can than to accumulate a sum of money. Money itself doesn’t build relationships, create memories, bring you closer to your loved ones, or express who you are to the world. It’s how you spend money that can make those things easier. When you optimize for net fulfillment over net worth, it’s a whole different game. It shifted my “save to make number go up” mindset to a different frame: “spend what we are able to on the things that matter most.
